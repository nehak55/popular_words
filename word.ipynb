       "this is now the reality of iraq. and it is not enough for the president to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of american resolve. the american people have been extraordinarily resolved. it’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding american forces will only relieve the iraqis from doing more on their own. the american soldiers i met when i traveled to iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question. moreover, it could be suspended if at any point u.s. commanders believe that a further reduction would put american troops in danger. as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists. but instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in american history. and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the american people.</td> \n",

       "this is now the reality of iraq. now, i am hopeful that the iraq study group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus. and so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in iraq. rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security. what is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the president to respond to iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same. it may be politically advantageous for the president to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in iraq. namely, preventing iraq from becoming what afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the middle east, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home. there is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in iraq. the american soldiers i met when i traveled to iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question. they have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in iraq. i have long said that the only solution in iraq is a political one. to reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end. a phased redeployment of u.s. troops from iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months. that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure iraq. the redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels. drawing down our troops in iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to northern iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force. this force could help prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in northern iraq, reassure allies in the gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region. the president’s decision to go to war in iraq has had disastrous consequences for afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control. by redeploying from iraq to afghanistan, we will answer nato’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism. as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists. in such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced u.s. force might remain in iraq for a more extended period of time. we would make clear in such a scenario that the united states would not be maintaining permanent military bases in iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the iraqi state and further polarization of iraqi society. any u.s. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in iraq. in the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that u.s. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing. the third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement. so far, congress has given the administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in iraq. finally, we have to realize that the entire middle east has an enormous stake in the outcome of iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution. but neither iran nor syria want to see a security vacuum in iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ? the goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various iraqi factions towards a political solution. if the iranians and syrians think they can use iraq as another afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken. as we change strategy in iraq, we should also think about what iraq has taught us about america’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism. many who supported the original decision to go to war in iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation. much has been written about how the military invasion of iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after baghdad fell. threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in iraq. the national intelligence estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism. the overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world. there is one other place where our mistakes in iraq have cost us dearly ? but to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ? i spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about iraq that was similar to the one i did today. the time for waiting in iraq is over.</td> \n",

       "this is now the reality of iraq. to pressure the iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control. the first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the iraqi government ? for only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the iraqi factions that the u.s. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ? the president should announce to the iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in u.s. forces. when possible, this should be done in consultation with the iraqi government ? but it should not depend on iraqi approval. but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ? we would make clear in such a scenario that the united states would not be maintaining permanent military bases in iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the iraqi state and further polarization of iraqi society. the second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ? who are deployed with iraqi as units advisers. an increase in the quality and quantity of u.s. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents. in the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that u.s. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing. of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police. we can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government. today, the iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the iraqi people or stabilize the country. the goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various iraqi factions towards a political solution.</td> \n",
